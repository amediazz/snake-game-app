## What is pharser.js ?:
pharser js is a free javascript library for 2D games
you dont need to built a system or a game engine installer
you can start with an html file and one javascript file

pharser organize codein three steps 

- [1] load assets in `preload` 
- [2] set up images and variables in `create` 
- [3] update your gamein each frame `update`

## Project setup 
create two files index.html and main.js
[x] - `index.html` will load the pharser from the CDN
[x] - `main.js` will create the game and attached to the div 

## Game config

Snake is easiest on a grid. You choose a tile size and a number of tiles wide and high. You also define colors for the background, the snake, and the food. Then you create a Phaser game config that points to your scene functions.

The config tells Phaser to create a canvas, set its size, and use your scene functions. Phaser.AUTO selects WebGL if possible and falls back to Canvas.

## Scene State and Helper Functions

You need to store the snakeâ€™s body as grid cells, the rectangles that draw those cells, the direction of travel, the queued input, the food cell, the score, and the movement timer. A few helper functions keep the math clean.
